He ignored a lone heckler, who shouted ``Go back to Oxford, you traitor, draft-dodger.'' Clinton's avoidance of the military draft while studying in England in the late 1960s brought harsh criticism from veterans during his 1992 presidential campaign, and last Memorial Day -- his first as commander in chief -- he met with heckling and a cool reception when he spoke at the Vietnam Veterans' Memorial.

Asked during a Saturday night television interview whether the reintroduction of the kuna would harm relations with Serbs, Tudjman replied: ``Serbs in Croatia must understand they are a minority.''

But even some of his own senior aides worry that the trip instead will remind Americans of Clinton's efforts to avoid the draft during the Vietnam war and underscore questions about his performance as commander-in- chief since becoming president.
Milwaukee-based Manpower's quarterly employment survey of more than 15,000 companies nationwide showed that 29 percent of the firms responding to the survey expect to undertake additional hiring during the summer while 7 percent plan staff reductions.

Benson's image as a foe of many small farmers was bolstered when he was battered by eggs thrown at him during a speaking engagement in South Dakota.

We don't have the communication that we used to.''

(End optional trim) The international and U.S. groups organizing the World Cup have designated levels of sponsorship, including ``official sponsors,'' who pay $17 million to $20 million for advertising rights, including billboard space on the playing fields in full view of TV cameras during the 52 games; ``marketing partners,'' who pay up to $10 million for ads on one side of the World Cup playing fields, and a variety of less expensive regional sponsorships.
In addition, each TV ``gold'' sponsor is rumored to have paid ABC nearly $3.5 million for game exposure throughout the 52 matches and for an undetermined number of 30-second spots during halftime and the pre- and post-game shows.
By comparison, a 30-second spot during last year's Super Bowl cost $900,000.
The second is that many of the Bush administration positions, including those singled out by Clinton during the campaign, were easier to criticize than to correct.

Breyer's friends say that as a justice he will emerge as a newly liberated champion of an updated form of judicial liberalism -- one who will uphold strong protections of civil rights and civil liberties but be more skeptical about the ability of federal judges to improve society than was the case during the court's liberal era under former chief justice Earl Warren.

She was dealing on such a public level that impacts all of our lives and would some of the small concerns that we go through during the day hold up in the bigger world?'' Documentaries, Kopple says, ``have so much drama and passion what we were afraid, `Would the fictional hold up to the documentary because the documentary is so strong?' Not until we got into the editing room did we see that yes, this is going to work.'' ``A Century of Women'' airs Tuesday-Thursday on TBS; all six hours repeat June 18.

Despite winning a ratings triple crown during the last television season -- taking the top spot in the prime time, daytime and late night Nielsens -- in recent months the network of ``Murphy Brown'' and ``Late Night With David Letterman'' has been showing clear signs of deterioration.
For one thing, CBS has failed to develop a new hit series during the recently completed TV season.
ABC, meanwhile, has scored with ``Home Improvement,'' ``NYPD Blue,'' and ``Grace Under Fire,'' while NBC has a new ratings winner in ``Frasier.'' Helped by the addition of the Super Bowl and World Series next season, ``I think there's a strong chance ABC will replace CBS as number one,'' said Jack Shubert, corporate media director at Earle Palmer Brown, a regional ad agency based in Bethesda, Md. ``ABC has a lot of strong comedies (``Roseanne,'' ``Home Improvement,'' ``Coach,'' etc.) anchoring its schedule during the week.

(Begin optional trim) Psychologically and politically, the U.S. casualties taken that day and during the subsequent 11 months of fighting until Nazi Germany's surrender gave America little option but to push aside instinct, reject a return to isolationism and instead stay on to help preserve the peace in Europe.
Some sharp foreign policy clashes during the Carter and Reagan presidencies and a love-hate relationship with the growing American cultural invasion led many Europeans to nurture a new stereotype of the United States -- that of a powerful, but naive ally, whose quick-trigger, overly simplistic world view constituted a danger only slightly less than that emanating from Moscow.

Dan Rostenkowski's brusque style during nearly 36 years in Congress has reflected the spoils-system, take-no-prisoners politics practiced in his hometown of Chicago; so ``Rosty'' was doing what comes naturally when he decided not to holler ``uncle'' and accept a plea bargain.
