MAO TSE-TUNG: New Evidence of Massive Deaths During His Reign  EDITOR'S NOTE  (BC-FEATURE-Mao's Deaths,0926)  Mao Tse-tung now stands accused of being responsible for the massacre or starvation of up to 80 million people during his long reign over China's billions.
 While the focus of many books and articles today is on China's successful economic reforms, dramatic new figures for the number of people who died as a result of Mao Tse-tung's policies are surfacing, along with horrifying proof of cannibalism during the Cultural Revolution.
``He was a monster.''  Hitler's policies led to the deaths of some 30 million during World War II and in concentration camps.
 Chinese government figures say between 15 million and 25 million people died unnatural deaths during Mao's reign from 1949 until his death in 1976.
One document, published in the Shanghai University journal ``Society'' last year -- and immediately yanked from shelves -- said 40 million people died during the great famine of 1959-1961.
 ``I think that the upheavals in the middle of the century, the famine and the Cultural Revolution, are still very much locked into the soul of China,'' says Perry Link, a professor at Princeton University in Princeton, N.J.  ``Modern China's not going to find its way into the 21st century unless the Chinese people can feel that they really got to the bottom of how such things happened.''  Andrew Walder, a Harvard sociologist working with Gong to examine hundreds of recently obtained Chinese documents on atrocities during the Cultural Revolution, acknowledged that some colleagues feel Mao's failures are old news.
The crackdown forced some Communist Party members and leading intellectuals to flee the country -- taking with them secret documents and new resolve to uncover the truth about how many died during Mao's rule, and to tell just how they died.
 Chen, 54, fled to the United States and founded the Center for Modern China, based in Princeton, N.J.  Using smuggled government documents, Chinese population statistics and interviews with police and villagers in four Chinese provinces, Chen calculated that as many as 43 million people died during the famine that followed Mao's absurd industrial campaign, the Great Leap Forward of 1958-60.
 ``The truth will be much higher than this figure, believe it,'' he said during a recent interview at his Princeton University apartment.
He recalls eating rats and snakes during the famine to supplement his prison rations, burying countless fellow inmates who starved to death.
 Zheng Yi was one of China's leading contemporary writers before he fled Beijing after helping to organize intellectuals during the Tiananmen uprising.
He arrived in Princeton, a center for many Chinese dissidents, in 1992 and finished a book about political cannibalism during the Cultural Revolution.
 Cannibalism was practiced in ancient times because some believed human blood held medicinal powers and again during the Great Famine in matters of life or death.
