(AP)  (BC-Sports-Basketball-Warriors-Gugliotta,0454)  Golden State and Washington say they never discussed the Chris Webber-for-Tom Gugliotta trade before the final few days, but Gugliotta said Friday the Bullets told him two weeks ago they were talking about such a deal.
 Golden State had to re-sign Webber, a restricted free agent, before trading him or even discussing a trade with other teams.
Such negotiations before Webber was re-signed could constitute collusion.
 Warriors general manager and coach Don Nelson said Thursday he had no discussions with Washington or any other team about a Webber trade before Wednesday night, though Webber had given the Warriors a list of teams for which he'd be willing to play.
 Bullets general manager John Nash also has vehemently denied talking with Golden State about such a trade before Webber re-signed.
 ``We have had absolutely no dialogue with Golden State and I have no idea of whether they're interested in trading Chris Webber,'' he said before a Nov.
 Gugliotta, in a conference call Friday with Bay Area reporters, said the Bullets had informed him long before Wednesday that they were talking about a trade for Webber.
 The Washington Post quoted a source Thursday as saying the Warriors and Bullets had been told by the NBA that the league would investigate charges the teams discussed a trade before Webber had re-signed.
