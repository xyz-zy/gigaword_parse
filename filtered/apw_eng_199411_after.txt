 The government, which came to power in January 1992 after canceling elections the Salvation Front was winning, refused an invitation and denounced Sant'Egidio for ``interference in internal affairs.''

They include independent Algeria's first president, Ahmed Ben Bella, and Hocine Ait Ahmed, who leads a party rooted in the Berber minority.

Rebels, Government Sign Treaty after 19 Years of War  LUSAKA, Zambia (AP)  (BC-Angola, 6th Ld-Writethru)  Repeating a ritual that has twice failed to end their 19-year civil war, Angola's government and rightist rebels on Sunday signed a peace accord hailed as a symbol of new cooperation and conciliation in southern Africa.
 Twice before, in 1989 and 1991, dos Santos and Savimbi shook hands at elaborate ceremonies after signing treaties intended to halt one of Africa's bloodiest and cruelest wars.
 The absence of Savimbi showed the lack of trust between UNITA and the government after almost two decades of war that erupted on the eve of independence from Portugal in 1975 and has killed more than 500,000 and devastated the oil and mineral rich nation off southern Africa's Atlantic Coast.
The role of Savimbi, who is widely blamed for continuing the war after losing 1992 elections to dos Santos, has yet to be determined.
 UNITA found itself isolated after fighting resumed in 1992.
