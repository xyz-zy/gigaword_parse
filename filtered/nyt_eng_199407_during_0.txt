The bizarre nature of dreams is beginning to make sense to scientists who study the biological and physiological changes that occur in the brain during sleep, wakefulness and the many related states, like dreamless sleep, daydreaming and, some say, the writing of poetry and other creative acts.
For example, researchers have found that during sleep the brain is bombarded by wild, erratic pulses from the brainstem and flooded with nervous system chemicals that induce the insanity of dreams.
It processes these signals in vast, oscillating networks of brain cells to form representations of the external world and combines these maps with memories, movements, emotions and forethought in a way that gives rise to self-awareness and an ability to navigate the world during waking hours.
Other nodes release so-called cholinergic chemicals which, although active in performing important brain functions during the day, begin to dominate the brain's chemistry.
Instead of firing steadily, as they do during the day, these cells begin bursting hundreds of times a second and sending erratic pulses into higher brain regions.
These pulses, called PGO, or pontine-geniculate-occipital, waves, occur only during dreams and have multiple effects.
And it explains why sleepwalking almost always occurs during nondream sleep, when the muscles are not paralyzed.
The higher networks, which are used to making representations of the world during the waking state, try to make sense of the internal images and feelings by concocting stories in the cholinergic brain, he said.
He points out that such states exist during meditation, as well as sometimes when people are in sensory isolation tanks.
The lids move during dream sleep, whereas head movements tend to occur when dreams end and nondream sleep or the transition to wakefulness occurs, said Robert Stickgold, a researcher in the laboratory.
A Nightcap user can program the device to sound a signal during a dream episode to wake him up, so that he can recall the dreams.

Now the sponsors of Univision's soccer coverage have come up with their own cry: ``CRAAAAAWL!'' Those shrieks of glee are for crawls, or crawlers, as Univision calls the short commercial vignettes it runs in lieu of traditional spots during the 52 matches it will have broadcast through Sunday.
``That would be a disaster,'' he added, praising the crawls as ``a great way to get someone's attention yet at the same time not mess with their soccer game.'' Karwoski shudders at the memory of the TNT cable television network's coverage of World Cup '90: twice, it cut away as goals were being scored, once during the quarter finals, missing the only goal in a 1-0 victory of Italy over Ireland.
So although the match is clearly visible to viewers during the brief time each crawl appears, Karwoski said, ``someone still has to watch the game and make a decision when to insert a crawl,'' to minimize its potential for disruption.
Univision has broadcast crawls since 1982, when, during its initial broadcasts of the World Cup, it picked up the Spanish-language feed from Mexican television, which has used them for many years.

Judging by how far the water levels dropped during these periods -- as much as 50 feet in some cases -- Stine concluded that the droughts were not only much longer, they were far more severe than either the drought of 1928 to 1934, California's worst in modern times, or the more recent severe dry spell of 1987 to 1992.
Any significant global warming would probably cause changes in atmospheric circulation and precipitation patterns, and the new findings suggest that ``during much of medieval time the planetary ocean-atmosphere system operated in a mode unlike that of modern time,'' Stine wrote in Nature.
But, he said, ``the vast majority of years during the past 3,500 years have been much drier than what we've come to expect to be normal in California.'' The evidence for the medieval drought periods is especially strong, Hughes said, because the lake basins are closed, with no natural outlets; consequently, their water levels are influenced only by inflow and evaporation, making them ideal gauges of drought.

NEW BOOK SAYS REAGAN'S CIA CHIEF TRIED TO LOWER CRUDE OIL PRICE WASHINGTON  (BC-OIL-REAGAN-HNS) At a time when many oil patch Republicans are criticizing President Clinton for ignoring the plight of domestic oil producers, a new book provides evidence that the Reagan administration actively encouraged lower oil prices during the price collapse in 1985 and 1986.

RESEARCHERS FIND MEMORIES ARE CONSOLIDATED DURING SLEEP  (BC-SLEEP-MEMORY-2TAKES-NYT) In separate experiments conducted on rats and humans, scientists have found the first direct evidence that memories are consolidated during sleep.
This provided the best evidence so far that memories are consolidated during sleep.
Humans also use the hippocampus to acquire and store so-called declarative memories, involving all the events with which a person is involved during waking hours.
Hippocampal place cells that fired together when the rats explored the box showed an increased tendency to fire together during sleep, Wilson said.
During this reorganization and consolidation of memories, he said, the brain creates a more useful representation of information than what was stored during the actual experiences.
They were roused about 60 times during the night.

`TRIBE' OFFERS AN INTERESTING LOOK AT THE CAT FAMILY  (BC-THOMAS-BOOK-REVIEW-550&ADD-NYT) In many ways, cats are not as easy as dogs for people to make friends with, which may explain why Elizabeth Marshall Thomas' new book, ``The Tribe of Tiger: Cats and Their Culture,'' does not have quite the warm appeal of her best-selling book of last year, ``The Hidden Life of Dogs.'' But cats, too, have their considerable allure, as Ms. Thomas makes clear in her introductory reference to Christopher Smart, the 18th-century English poet, who found during his eight-year solitary confinement in a madhouse that his only relief from loneliness and despair was provided by the presence of his cat, Jeoffry.

And I didn't know what to do with them, so I stuffed it in my pocket.'' There isn't enough space here to get into Rizzuto's whole recitation of being raised in Brooklyn and his family that means so much to him, especially his wife, Cora, and his baseball career or his time in the Navy during World War II when he even got seasick on the ferry from New Jersey to Virginia, and people said, ``He's going to protect us?'' and how he said he starts stories at the end and goes back to the beginning and winds up in the middle, but he paid tribute to many, including two he was inducted into the Hall of Fame with, Leo Durocher and Steve Carlton, and told a story of Durocher being a great bench jockey as well as a great manager and when he popped a ball straight up and the catcher caught it in a World Series against the Dodgers, Durocher hollered, ``That's a home run in an elevator shaft!'' And Carlton, sitting right behind him on the dais with some 30 Hall of Famers, threw back his head and laughed, old Stone Face and old Mum Mouth to the reporters, even though they voted him into the hall on the first ballot and he did thank them for it, but Lefty to the ballplayers who loved him if he was their teammate and hated him if they had to face his wicked slider and fadeaway fastball said that everything seems to come in cycles.
It was at Cooperstown in an exhibition game during induction week in 1966 that Carlton was called up to the St. Louis Cardinals after having been sent down to the minors to pitch on that day to the Minnesota Twins, and he struck out 10 batters in seven innings and went on from there to strike out more batters than anyone in baseball history outside of Nolan Ryan and also performed the amazing feat in 1972 of winning 27 games for the Philadelphia Phillies, a forlorn, last-place team that won just 59 games altogether that season, and he also said another old Phillie, Richie Ashburn, should be in the Hall of Fame.

LEFTY SPEAKS, AND SCOOTER HAS HIS DAY COOPERSTOWN, N.Y.  (BC-BBO-HALL-OF-FAME-600&ADD-NYT) Steve Carlton, a man of few words who let his slider do his speaking during a 24-year career as the dominant left-handed pitcher of his era, found voice Sunday, if only long enough to accept induction into the National Baseball Hall of Fame along with Phil Rizzuto and the late Leo Durocher.
